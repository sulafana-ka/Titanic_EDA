Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, identifying key survival factors through visual and statistical methods using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

üö¢ Project Overview

This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic disaster dataset. The primary objective was to use visual and statistical exploration to understand and identify the key social and economic factors that influenced passenger survival.

The entire analysis was performed using the Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


üîç Key Findings

The analysis successfully determined that survival was overwhelmingly dependent on factors of privilege and protocol:

Gender: Females were the single strongest predictor of survival, confirming the "women and children first" protocol.

Passenger Class: Socio-economic status was critical. There is a strong negative correlation between Pclass and survival, meaning First Class passengers were the most likely to survive, and Third Class passengers were the least likely.

Age: The overall age of a passenger was a weak predictor of survival, as the median age for both survivor and non-survivor groups was very similar.

‚úÖ Deliverables

This repository contains the two required submission files:

TitanicEDA.ipynb: This is the complete Jupyter Notebook. It includes all the Python code for data loading, cleaning (handling missing Age and Embarked values), statistical exploration, and the generation of all visual plots (Gender, PClass, Age Boxplot, and Correlation Heatmap).

TitanicEDA-PDF.pdf: This is the final PDF report that summarizes the statistical findings, presents the key insights from the visualizations, and provides the overall conclusion.
